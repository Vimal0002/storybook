My approach is centered on creating a self-contained, high-quality, and robust React application that can be run directly within a single file. 
This is crucial for environments like the one we are in, as it bypasses external dependencies and complex project setups, allowing you to see a working, interactive demo immediately.

### **Component-Driven Development**

My primary strategy is to use **component-driven development**. 
I break down the entire application into smaller, reusable pieces (like `InputField` and `DataTable`). This makes the code easier to manage and test. 
Each component is designed to be **modular** and **independent**, so it can be used in different parts of the application or even in new projects without requiring major changes.

* **Generic Components**: The `DataTable` component, for example, is built to be generic using TypeScript. 
This means it can accept any kind of data (users, products, etc.) as long as it conforms to the specified type, making it incredibly flexible.

### **Modern Web Technologies**

I build the applications using a modern and efficient technology stack:

* **React & TypeScript**: 

These are the core technologies. React handles the UI, and TypeScript provides static typing, which helps prevent bugs and improves code quality.

* **Tailwind CSS**: 
Instead of writing traditional CSS, I use **Tailwind CSS**.Itâ€™s a utility-first framework that lets me style the components directly within the JSX.
This approach is fast, makes the styling highly consistent, and ensures the application is **fully responsive** from the start.

### **Interactive and User-Centric Design**

The goal is to create more than just a functional app; it should also be a good experience.

* **Features**: 
I include key features like **sorting**, **row selection**, and **form validation** to make the components more powerful and interactive.


* **Aesthetics**: 
The design is clean and modern, with proper spacing, shadows, and hover effects. 
I also include a **dark mode toggle** to demonstrate an important accessibility feature and give users a choice.


* **User Feedback**: 
The components are built with user feedback in mind. 
For example, the `DataTable` shows a loading spinner to indicate that data is being fetched, preventing a blank screen and reassuring the user that the app is working.
